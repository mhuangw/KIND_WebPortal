# KIND_WebPortal
Developing a webportal to support KIND non-profit. Sponsored by Microsoft Hackathon.

This app utilizes [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), a framework for hybrid mobile app development. It uses Angular and allows for deploying apps to iOS and Android devices.

You will first need to install [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (packaged together). To verify the installation, type the following commands into a terminal prompt:

<code>
node --version 

npm --version
</code>

Once Node and npm are installed, use the following command to install the Ionic CLI:

<code>
npm install -g ionic
</code>


If you have an Ionic account, you can also login and take advantage of Ionic Pro features with the following command:

<code>
ionic login
</code>


To run the app, cd into your app's directory (myApp in this case) and type:

<code>
ionic serve
</code>

User goals:

* KIND employees and attorneys:

o Add content easily

* Kids and attorneys:

o Discover content easily that is relevant to them

o Consume content easily


# Deliverable #2: Enable interaction between pro bono attorneys, KIND employees, and children
User scenario: These three entities need to interact with each other need to have an easy way to communicate with each other to discuss the cases and insights into the process.
